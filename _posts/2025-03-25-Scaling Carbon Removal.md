Meeting global climate targets will require not only aggressive decarbonization but also significant carbon removal from the atmosphere. According to IPCC projections, we need to remove between 100-1000 billion tonnes of CO₂ cumulatively by 2100, with annual removal rates reaching 5-16 billion tonnes by 2050. Decarbonization solutions alone—such as renewable energy deployment, electrification of transport, and industrial efficiency improvements—are proving insufficient for several critical reasons: 

- Certain sectors like aviation, agriculture, and heavy industry face prohibitively expensive or technologically challenging pathways to zero emissions; we've already exceeded 80% of our carbon budget for the 1.5°C target;
- Emissions from existing infrastructure are "locked in" for decades without premature retirement; historical emissions have created a carbon debt that must be addressed.

Carbon removal solutions, including both nature-based approaches (reforestation, soil carbon sequestration) and engineered solutions (direct air capture, enhanced weathering), offer essential complementary strategies to extract legacy carbon while addressing residual carbon from hard-to-abate sectors. 

### Setting the Stage: Technology Scope and Solutions Overview

**Carbon Capture vs. Carbon Removal**

It's important to distinguish between carbon capture and carbon removal. Carbon capture is an abatement technology, usually intercepting CO₂ at concentrated point sources such as power plants or industrial facilities before it enters the atmosphere. By preventing new emissions from entering the atmosphere, the otherwise carbon-emitting process becomes carbon-neutral. On the other hand, carbon removal can extract existing CO2 from the air and is truly carbon-negative. With large amounts of residual carbons that are unlikely to be abated through technologies, as well as a substantial amount of carbon debt from historical emissions, carbon removal is increasingly becoming a critical solution to achieve net-zero goals.

**Solutions Overview**

Within carbon removal space, various technologies exist, ranging from engineering-based to nature-based, with varying trade-offs.

#### Engineering-Based Solutions

**Direct Air Capture Technologies**

Direct air capture (DAC) technologies extract CO₂ directly from ambient air through engineered systems. DAC offers several advantages: it requires minimal land area compared to nature-based solutions, delivers highly verifiable carbon removal, and can scale significantly without biological constraints. However, contemporary DAC systems remain energy-intensive and expensive, with current costs ranging from $250-$600 per tonne of CO₂ removed. Companies like Climeworks, Carbon Engineering, and Heirloom, early movers who now operate commercial-scale plants, are working to drive down these costs through technological innovation and economies of scale, with projections suggesting costs could fall below $100 per tonne by 2035. Emerging DAC innovations focus on reducing energy requirements, with Verdox developing electrochemical systems that can reduce energy consumption by up to 70% compared to conventional approaches, while Noya retrofits existing cooling towers to capture CO₂ during normal industrial operations.

**Enhanced Weathering and Geological Storage**

Enhanced weathering accelerates natural geochemical processes wherein certain minerals react with CO₂ to form stable carbonates. Through mineralization, the solution offers exceptionally permanent geological storage measured in thousands to millions of years. Emerging companies in this space include Carbfix, which injects CO₂ into basalt formations where it mineralizes within two years, and Project Vesta, which is exploring coastal enhanced weathering using olivine. CarbonCure uses a similar approach but injects CO₂ into concrete during manufacturing, where it mineralizes while simultaneously strengthening the concrete. While these approaches promise very long-term carbon sequestration, the development costs are high due to the energy requirements for rock processing. Proving the quality presents another barrier due to potential environmental impacts and the current lack of standardized measurement methodologies.

**Ocean-Based Technologies**

Ocean-based carbon removal solutions employ diverse engineering approaches beyond ecosystem restoration. Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) adds alkaline materials to seawater to enhance CO₂ absorption capacity, with companies like Planetary Technologies developing electrochemical systems and mineral dispersion techniques. Ocean Iron Fertilization stimulates phytoplankton blooms by adding iron to nutrient-limited regions, causing carbon to be sequestered when biomass sinks to the deep ocean, though ecological concerns have limited its deployment. Artificial upwelling/downwelling systems use wave-powered pumps and mechanical devices to either bring nutrient-rich deep water to the surface to enhance biological productivity or transport carbon-rich surface water to depth for long-term storage. Direct Ocean Capture, pioneered by companies like Equatic, removes dissolved CO₂ from seawater using electrochemical processes that simultaneously address ocean acidification. These technologies remain primarily at the pilot scale, facing challenges in monitoring, international governance, and environmental impact assessment, but offer theoretical sequestration potential at the gigatonne scale needed for meaningful climate mitigation.

#### Hybrid Solutions

**Biomass Carbon Removal and Storage (BiCRS)**

BiCRS leverages photosynthesis with enhanced storage mechanisms, differing from Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), which focuses on carbon-neutral biomass energy production with carbon capture and is often considered a hybrid solution. Within BiCRS, solutions vary depending on the feedstock, conversion process, and sequestration methods. Charm Industrial converts agricultural waste biomass into bio-oil through pyrolysis, then injects this stable carbon-rich liquid deep underground. Biochar production companies like Carbofex thermally convert biomass into stable carbon materials that can persist in soils for centuries while improving agricultural productivity. Newer approaches include ocean-based concepts like macroalgae cultivation followed by deep sea sequestration. Running Tide, for example, grows seaweed on biodegradable buoys that eventually sink to the deep ocean floor, where pressure and low-oxygen conditions preserve the carbon for centuries. On the flip side, these technologies face implementation challenges including sustainable biomass sourcing, land use competition with food production, and the need for comprehensive life-cycle analysis to ensure net carbon negativity.

#### Nature-based solutions (NBS)

**Terrestrial Carbon Removal**

Terrestrial carbon removal encompasses a diverse range of land management approaches designed to enhance natural carbon sinks. **Afforestation and reforestation** projects establish tree cover on previously non-forested or deforested lands, respectively. These initiatives typically involve planting native or climate-adapted tree species, with sequestration rates varying from 5-20 tCO₂e per hectare annually depending on climate, species, and management practices. **Improved forest management** enhances carbon storage in existing forests through practices like extended harvest rotations, reduced-impact logging, and fire management, yielding approximately 2-10 tCO₂e per hectare annually while supporting biodiversity and watershed protection. Agricultural **soil carbon enhancement** strategies are gaining significant traction due to their scalability and co-benefits. Regenerative agriculture practices—including cover cropping, reduced tillage, crop rotation, and improved grazing management—can sequester 0.5-3 tCO₂e per hectare annually while improving soil health, water retention, and crop resilience. Major corporate players like Bayer, Cargill, and Indigo Agriculture have established programs to incentivize and verify agricultural carbon sequestration, though questions about permanence and additionality continue to drive methodology refinements.

**Coastal Blue Carbon**

Coastal blue carbon ecosystems—mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows—represent some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems on Earth, sequestering carbon at rates 3-5 times higher than terrestrial forests on a per-area basis. Mangrove forests, found in tropical and subtropical intertidal zones, can sequester 6-8 tCO₂e per hectare annually in living biomass and up to 25 tCO₂e per hectare annually when including soil carbon. Tidal salt marshes, dominant in temperate regions, accumulate 4-8 tCO₂e per hectare annually primarily in sediments. Seagrass meadows store approximately 2-4 tCO₂e per hectare annually in their extensive root systems and sediments, with carbon deposits often accumulating over millennia in anoxic conditions. Project implementation faces unique challenges due to complex ownership structures in coastal zones, technical difficulties in restoration, and the specialized expertise 

### Why is Scaling Hard: Challenging Business Model

The carbon removal market faces a fundamental structural challenge that complicates its path to scale. At its core, project developers confront a precarious business model where their sole revenue stream depends on selling carbon credits to a limited pool of buyers with increasingly stringent quality requirements. This creates a complex economic environment that hinders the rapid deployment of carbon removal solutions despite their critical importance for climate goals.

Corporate and institutional buyers increasingly demand high-quality carbon credits with proven additionality, permanence, and precise measurement. This preference naturally favors engineered solutions like direct air capture and mineralization, which offer straightforward carbon accounting and verifiable long-term storage. However, these technological approaches face prohibitive upfront capital requirements and high operating costs, with current prices ranging from $250-$1000 per ton of CO₂ removed. The resulting credits, while high in quality, remain too expensive for widespread adoption, limiting demand to a small segment of premium buyers with substantial climate commitments.

Conversely, nature-based solutions such as reforestation, improved land management, and blue carbon projects offer significantly lower costs, typically between $10-$50 per ton CO₂. These approaches bring valuable co-benefits for biodiversity and communities, making them attractive from multiple perspectives. The primary challenge for these solutions is to demonstrate high quality, including proving **permanence**, minimizing **leakage**, ensuring **accurate measurement**, and delivering **verifiable community benefits**. Due to insufficient measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) standards and tooling, these methodological challenges create buyer hesitation and downward price pressure, constraining revenue potential for developers despite lower implementation costs.

This mismatch between supply and demand creates a problematic dynamic: high-quality engineered removals remain too expensive for most buyers, while more affordable nature-based solutions face quality concerns that limit their market acceptance and price potential. Project developers thus find themselves caught between insufficient demand for premium-priced removals and quality skepticism for lower-cost alternatives. The resulting financing gap has stalled many promising carbon removal initiatives, as developers struggle to secure the upfront capital needed when future revenue streams remain uncertain and potentially insufficient for attractive returns on investment.

### Bridging the Carbon Removal Market Gap: A Multi-Stakeholder Approach

With such structural challenges, coordination across multiple stakeholders is the only way to scale the market. Each participant in the ecosystem has a distinct role to play in creating a more functional marketplace and bridging the current gap between carbon removal supply and demand more effectively. 

#### Policy Makers: Creating the Foundation

Policymakers set the foundation of the market by mandating emission targets on industries. The Paris Agreement's Article 6, which enables carbon markets to meet country-level climate commitments, is one of the key reasons the market even exists. While the traditional policy tools focus on reporting and disclosure, policymakers are increasingly taking a forward-looking approach to guide the development of targets and implementation. Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guides businesses to set emission reduction targets aligned with the net-zero goals. It specifically recognizes the role of carbon removal in addressing residual carbons, with the latest draft of the Corporate Net-Zero Standard proposing interim carbon removal targets to scale up the carbon removal industry. Broadening the adoption of these protocols expands carbon removal demands and improves market liquidity.

Governments can also directly drive demand by procuring carbon projects and catalyzing the markets. The U.S. Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Removal Purchase Pilot plans to allocate $35 million to purchase verified carbon removal credits. Similarly, the UK's £100 million Direct Air Capture and Greenhouse Gas Removal Innovation Competition targets emerging technologies that would otherwise struggle to secure sufficient private financing.

#### MRV: Providing Critical Tooling to Remove Friction

At the moment, diverse verification agencies exist, including Verra, Gold Standard, the American Carbon Registry, and Climate Action Reserve. With different verification and measurement methodologies adopted by different projects, buyers often struggle to differentiate projects and purchase high-quality carbon credits to meet organizations' goals. Standardizing the Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework, especially around high-quality carbon credits, holds the key to growing the market. 

Meaningful development has been made to provide guidance top-down: The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market has developed Core Carbon Principles as a global benchmark for high-quality credits; The Carbon Credit Quality Initiative (CCQI), further offers standardized scoring methodologies for evaluating credit integrity, known as CCQI scores; The EU's Carbon Removal Certification Framework represents the first comprehensive regulatory approach to standardizing carbon removal methodologies across different approaches; The U.S. The Department of Energy and EPA are jointly developing verification standards for carbon removal projects under the Inflation Reduction Act's enhanced 45Q tax credits. 

Meanwhile, quantifying carbon emission impacts for various technologies remains unsolved, and research institutions should step up to fill the science gap. Stanford's Carbon Removal Initiative has developed methodologies for emerging removal approaches. Princeton's Carbon Mitigation Initiative has created measurement standards for ocean-based solutions. The World Resources Institute's Carbon Removal Measurement Framework provides comprehensive guidelines for quantifying removal across different project types. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has established measurement approaches for enhanced weathering projects. The Carbon Disclosure Project has expanded its framework to include detailed carbon removal information for corporate strategies. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures has incorporated carbon removal into its reporting recommendations.

As innovative MRV technologies being developed, experimenting and adopting such tools would further facilitate the implementation:

- Verification is being transformed by startups applying advanced technologies to traditional challenges. CarbonPlan has developed open-source verification tools that independently assess forest carbon claims against satellite data. Sylvera uses machine learning to rate carbon projects against consistent quality criteria. Chloris Geospatial employs AI-driven satellite analysis to verify forest carbon stocks against claimed baselines. These innovations address the subjectivity and inconsistency that have undermined traditional verification approaches by providing data-driven, transparent assessment methodologies.
- Startups are revolutionizing carbon measurement through technological breakthroughs. Pachama combines satellite imagery, LiDAR data, and machine learning to measure forest carbon with unprecedented precision. NCX uses high-resolution monitoring to quantify forest carbon at the individual tree level. Regrow Ag integrates satellite imagery with biogeochemical modeling for soil carbon quantification. Kuva Systems and Project Canary offer continuous emissions monitoring technologies that capture real-time data. These innovations shift carbon accounting from estimation-based to measurement-based approaches, fundamentally improving accuracy.
- Digital platforms are transforming how carbon data is collected, analyzed, and reported. Watershed's enterprise carbon management platform automates emissions calculations across complex value chains. CarbonChain provides industry-specific tools that integrate with operational data systems. Toucan Protocol and Flowcarbon have developed blockchain infrastructure, creating immutable records of credit transactions. The World Bank's Climate Warehouse uses distributed ledger technology to harmonize reporting across multiple carbon registries. These innovations address fragmentation and transparency concerns by creating standardized, auditable reporting systems.

#### Corporate Buyers: More than Offtaking

Corporate buyers play a foundational role in the development of carbon markets. With a handful of first-mover corporate buyers, specifically Microsoft and Meta, having asymmetric power, these corporations can not only provide demand but actually influence the standards and shape the markets. Microsoft's $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund exemplifies this approach, funding diverse carbon removal solutions while simultaneously developing rigorous procurement criteria that have influenced market-wide quality standards. The company's collaboration with Carbon Direct to establish scientific diligence methodologies has created frameworks now adopted by other major purchasers. Meta partnered with the World Resources Institute to develop a corporate carbon removal framework that addresses credit quality, permanence, and additionality—principles now widely referenced across the industry. Stripe's detailed carbon removal procurement documentation, published openly, provides a benchmark for technical assessment that smaller buyers have leveraged to inform their own purchases.

Corporate buyers can also support technological innovations through innovative derisking approaches. Buyer consortia is one way to share the risk through demand aggregation. Frontier Climate, backed by Stripe, Shopify, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey with an initial $925 million commitment, operates as an advance market commitment (AMC) for carbon removal, focusing on nature-based solutions. The First Movers Coalition, launched at COP26 with members including Amazon, Apple, and Volvo, focuses on decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors while supporting emerging technologies including carbon removal.

Strategically building diversified portfolios provides another derisking tool for buyers to support the long-term development of the ecosystem while meeting their strategic goals. Shopify balances investments across the durability spectrum, allocating approximately 50% of its Sustainability Fund to engineered solutions with high permanence while supporting immediate climate action through higher-volume, lower-cost nature-based approaches. Swiss Re's carbon removal strategy explicitly combines near-term purchases of nature-based solutions with forward contracts for emerging engineered approaches, providing bridge funding for promising technologies. Amazon's Right Now Climate Fund and Climate Pledge Fund demonstrate a similarly balanced approach, with the former supporting nature-based solutions that deliver immediate carbon benefits while the latter invests in breakthrough technologies, including direct air capture companies like CarbonCapture Inc. 

#### Project Developers: Keeping the Reality in Mind

Project developers must prioritize transparency and integrity in technical fundamentals while building commercially viable business models. For project quality, this means implementing rigorous baseline methodologies with conservative assumptions, providing comprehensive 'additionality' documentation that withstands scrutiny, establishing robust long-term monitoring protocols that address permanence concerns, conducting thorough leakage risk assessments with corresponding mitigation strategies, and transparently reporting environmental and social impacts beyond carbon benefits. The most successful developers don't simply meet minimum standards but anticipate evolving requirements, providing detailed technical documentation that facilitates buyer due diligence and builds market confidence.

Equally important is ensuring commercial viability through strategic team composition and market alignment. Successful developers assemble cross-disciplinary teams combining scientific expertise with industry-specific operational knowledge and financial acumen. They conduct thorough market analysis to understand buyer preferences before finalizing project design, develop multiple revenue streams beyond carbon credits to reduce financial vulnerability, determine minimum viable project scale to balance MRV costs with competitive pricing, and structure projects to deliver returns while managing risks. By focusing simultaneously on technical integrity and commercial fundamentals, developers can create projects that not only deliver genuine climate benefits but also attract the investment necessary to scale their impact.

Leading project developers are demonstrating how carbon removal solutions can achieve commercial viability. Climeworks has progressively scaled its direct air capture technology from small demonstration units to the 4,000-ton-per-year Orca facility in Iceland, with its recently announced Mammoth project targeting ten times that capacity. Through "stackable" business models, developers can improve project economics through multiple revenue streams. For example, Charm Industrial produces bio-oil through pyrolysis of agricultural waste, generating carbon removal credits while addressing agricultural residue challenges; Carbofex produces biochar for carbon removal credits while also selling biochar products for agricultural and water filtration applications, improving project economics through multiple revenue streams. Heirloom's partnership with Nucor Steel demonstrates how carbon removal can be integrated with traditional heavy industry, with Nucor providing industrial space, steam supply, and technical expertise for Heirloom's limestone-based direct air capture technology.

#### Financiers and Investors: Providing Patient Capital and Partnerships

The market scaling ultimately requires capital. Given the challenging business model, combining funding resources through blended finance is likely a must-have feature for the market to scale.

Philanthropic foundations have become crucial early supporters of carbon removal innovation. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative committed $44 million to the Carbon Removal Research Program at the University of California, while the ClimateWorks Foundation has dedicated significant funding to policy development and market infrastructure for carbon removal. The Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust provided early funding to Climeworks, demonstrating how philanthropic capital can support technological pioneers.

Government grant programs provide essential non-dilutive funding for technological development. ARPA-E's ATTACH program awarded $35 million to 12 projects developing direct air capture technologies, while the EU Innovation Fund is deploying billions of euros toward breakthrough climate technologies, including significant support for Climeworks' Orca direct air capture facility in Iceland.

Investors with higher risk tolerance are filling crucial capital gaps. Breakthrough Energy Ventures, founded by Bill Gates, has invested in carbon removal companies including Verdox and Sustaera, while Lowercarbon Capital, founded by Chris Sacca, has backed companies like Running Tide, Charm Industrial, and Holy Grail with early-stage capital specifically targeting carbon removal technologies.

Vehicles that pool public and private capital together offer another blended finance structure. The Carbon Removal Catalytic Capital (CRCC) Initiative pools funds from Stripe, McKinsey Sustainability, Shopify, and Meta to provide early-stage funding for promising carbon removal approaches. The World Bank's Climate Emission Reduction Facility combines public and private financing to support climate projects in developing economies.

Somewhat controversially, Oil and Gas companies with budgets allocated to corporate innovations to diversify their business models are also uniquely positioned to accelerate carbon removal deployment. They can provide not just sizable capital but also infrastructure, expertise, and demand to support the projects from end to end. Occidental Petroleum has emerged as a leader through its subsidiary 1PointFive, which is developing one of the world's largest direct air capture facilities in Texas with a planned capacity of 1 million tonnes annually. While the captured CO₂ has been used mostly for enhanced oil recovery, such partnerships help build out the critical supply chain components necessary for gigaton-scale carbon removal, paving the way for the sector to grow.
