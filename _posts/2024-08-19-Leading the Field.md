Written in the 1950s, the book was one of the earliest self-help books, synthesizing the work of Earl Nightingale, a renowned thinker and speaker. It's said that he wrote the book to pass on his life's thinking in mindset and success to his kids. Generations after, his work is still awakening minds - talking about legacy!

What do I love about this book?

- Wisdom: there's a reason why this is a classic. So much wisdom is packed into this one little book. Every chapter can be extended into a whole book by today's standards. The content is concise, straight-to-the-point, but not dry. There are just enough examples to illustrate the points.
- Writing: Mostly using short sentences, the writing is powerful but also colorful. There's a rhythm to almost every paragraph. While the wisdom reflects his depth as a thinker, the well-sounding writing exemplifies his mastery of the language and why he succeeded as a speaker, with words touching millions.

What have I been thinking after re-reading the book:

- Our attitude towards a situation often determines the outcome; our attitudes towards others often determine their attitudes towards us.
- We're capable of doing anything that comes to our mind (otherwise, they wouldn't come to our minds). To move in that direction, we must keep a mental picture of that and let it guide our thoughts, speech, and actions.
- Success is the gradual realization of a worthy goal. To find that worthy goal, stay true to ourselves. After we find it, stay focused: we can achieve anything, but not everything at once.
- Great people don't have less problems. They are better problem solvers. They work through their problems rather than running away from them.
- Great outcomes ultimately come from our services. Rather than focusing on outcomes, we ask ourselves every day, how can I improve my service and do things better?
