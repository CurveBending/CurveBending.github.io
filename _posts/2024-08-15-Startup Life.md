My partner is building an AI Agent startup. As we are deep in the tranches as a team, the startup life has also become a part of my life.

We're one year in, and the company is still in the very early stages. There are three volunteers/contractors helping out, but he's still the only one who is building the company full-time.

With this setup, he owns almost all the key domains: research, engineering, product, marketing, sales, etc. His unconventional career path makes this possible. Most people know him these days as an AI research scientist. But very few know that he was trained in business and spent years working as a marketer and then product manager before going back to school and starting over to learn AI. It doesn't make it easy.

That means I have to step up and fill the gap wherever it is needed, both for the business and for the family. I'm his sounding board in technology and engineering, his design partner in product, and his business partner in strategy, operation, finance, and business development. We make compromises on our schedules and lifestyles and have to constantly remind ourselves why we are doing this as a team.

So why are we doing this? We both see the future in AI agents and the imminent market needs. We believe that his research, combined with other advancement in the field, has solved the technology bottleneck. We have faith in the vision, strategy, and our ability to execute. Ultimately, we are motivated by the mission of building a great company and having a positive, lasting impact on society. 

Founding a company with little help is a lonely journey. But we learned the hard way that we have to keep the cofounding/hiring bar high, even if that means carrying the company ourselves until people can see what we see.

Focusing on the actual building is also hard, surprisingly. The modern-day startup wisdom is to focus on marketing and selling, get your name out there as quickly as possible, and raise and exit. Not many suggestions are geared toward building a long-standing company, even when they do on the surface.

Going into this, we both knew what this meant regarding our lifestyle. We made this decision together. Sometimes I wonder why I brought this on to my life when the alternative would be much less intense, stressful, and uncomfortable (spoiler alert: there's no glory in being a founder or a founder's partner when trying to build a real company)
And I have to remind myself of the answer I always know: to create something bigger than us and to live a life we won't regret.
